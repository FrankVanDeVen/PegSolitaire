# PegSolitaire
"Peg Solitaire" is a Peg Solitaire game clone for the Arduboy. 

From Wikipedia:
Peg Solitaire is a board game for one player involving movement of pegs on a board with holes. 
The standard game fills the entire board with pegs except for the central hole. The objective is, making valid moves, to empty the entire board except for a solitary peg in the central hole. A valid move is to jump a peg orthogonally (horizontally or vertically) over an adjacent peg into a hole two positions away and then to remove the jumped peg. 

Directional buttons: Move the cursor.
Button A: If the cursor is on a peg, select it. 
          If the cursor is on an empty space, you make a jump (if valid).
Button B: One step back.
